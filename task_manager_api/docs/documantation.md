# Task Manager API

## Overview

This is a simple RESTful API built using **Golang** and the **Gin web framework**. It allows you to manage a collection of tasks â€” create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) â€” using HTTP requests.

## Project Structure

The project is organized for clarity and maintainability:

- `models/`: Defines the structure of a **Task** (fields like ID, Title, Description, etc.).
- `controllers/`: Handles incoming HTTP requests and routes them to appropriate functions.
- `data/` or `services/`: Contains core logic and operations on task data (in-memory or persistent).
- `router/`: Configures all the available API routes using the Gin framework.
- `main.go`: Entry point of the application. Initializes the server and starts listening for requests.
